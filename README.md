In this repository, you will find the source code to various projects I have been working on or still work-in-progress. The majority of the projects are accompanied by a Medium blog posts.
My interests lie in the intersection of statistical techniques, data visualization, machine learning, deep learning , big data and sports (especially football). All the codes are written entirely in Python. I don't have a strong preference or attempt to make a concerted effort to code in a specific language/platform. The decision is mostly based on how specific functionalities needed for a project are supported (scraping in Python and data processing in Python).
